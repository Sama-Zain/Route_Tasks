1. What is the Node.js Event Loop?
the event loop is what makes Node.js able to run many tasks
without blocking,It keeps checking for finished async operations and runs their callbacks.

2. What is Libuv and its role in Node.js?
Libuv is a C library used by Node.js to handle asynchronous operations,
It provides the event loop, manages the thread pool

3. How does Node.js handle async operations?
Node.js sends async tasks to Libuv or the OS,
When they finish, the callback is added to a queue to be executed by the event loop.

4. Call Stack vs Event Queue vs Event Loop
Call Stack: runs normal JS code.
Event Queue: waits for async callbacks.
Event Loop: moves tasks from queue to Stack

5. What is the thread pool and how to set its size?
Thread pool is a group of threads used for heavy tasks like fs and crypto. Default is 4.
You can change it with: UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=6

6. Blocking vs Non-blocking code
Blocking: stops execution until it finishes.
Non-blocking: runs in background and doesn’t stop the app.
